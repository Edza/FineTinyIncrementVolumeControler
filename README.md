# FineTinyIncrementVolumeControler
Multiple volme controls? Ofen need to control tiny intervals like one volume controler from 0 to 6 and another from 20 - 30 and it's a pain in the ass?

This tool solves it. Set a global volume min like 10 and max like 30. And the control from 0 to 100 in that 10 to 30 interval!
